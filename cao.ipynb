    "Students applying for admission to third level education courses in Ireland apply to the CAO rather than to individual educational institutions such as colleges and universities. The CAO then offers places to students who meet the minimum requirements for a course for which they have applied. If for a particular course there are more qualified applicants than available places, the CAO makes offers to those applicants with the highest score in the CAO points system. If students do not accepts offers, or later decline them because they receive an offer for another course, the CAO makes further offers until all of the places have been filled or until the offer season closes.

    "The fetched data was ittered through and filtered out using the below regular expression. Regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on strings, or for input validation. [4] The set regular expression filters out only the lines starting with the course code (e.g. AL801). Also, Symbol \"&\" instead \"and\" was used in certain 2019 and 2020 course names and it was being decoded as \"&amp;\" when saving to csv. To avoid this *html.unescape* function was used. The data was also structured to fit the csv file - split and divided by commas to create 4 columns \"CODE\", \"TITLE\", \"R1_POINTS\", \"R2_POINTS\"."
