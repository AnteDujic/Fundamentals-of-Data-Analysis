    "A library is a collection of pre-combined codes that can be used iteratively to reduce the time required to code. They are particularly useful for accessing the pre-written frequently used codes, instead of writing them from scratch every single time.[1] A program must import a library module before using it. [2] To import a library we use the *import* statement.\n",

    "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.[3] It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.[4] Today, it is open source and it is actively developed by community. The source code for Matplotlib is located at this github repository https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib. [5] \n",
